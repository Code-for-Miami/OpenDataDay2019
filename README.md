# Open Data Day 2019
With greater access comes opportunity for innovation.This is an opportunity to show the benefits of open data and encourage the adoption of open data policies in government, business and civil society.

**This Year's Theme: Collaborative City**
Help us become a more collaborative city through access. Work on different projects related to our ongoing flood tracker project, criminal & social justice, mapping and visualizing our Miami, or contribute to our Data Census research, tracking the degree of openness of certain key datasets for the greater Miami area.

## March 2 @ CIC Miami, from 9AM to 5PM.

## Wondering how to propose or discuss your project ideas?

[GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) works just like any other commenting system on the Internet:


- First, you'll need to [create a github account](https://github.com/join).

- Then you have two options: (1) comment on an existing idea (a.k.a. "issue"), or (2) create a new idea.

If you see an idea that you're interested in, click on it, read the discussion and then add your thoughts to the bottom of the discussion thread. If you don't see the idea you have in mind, [add a new one](https://github.com/Code-for-Miami/OpenDataDay2018/issues/new). Someone from the Code for Miami Staff will respond with some questions or feedback.

*Here's a [quick video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4) on using Github Issues for discussion.*
